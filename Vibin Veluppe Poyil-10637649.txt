Issue faced:

I was unable to pull and save the .py file due to following error ; "Failed to save .py file": The content of the file is newer. Please compare your version with the file contents or overwrite the content of the file with your changes.

Resolution - Closed the visual studio code application , logged out from git. logged in again to git and opened the application and did a pull, and then saved the file.
